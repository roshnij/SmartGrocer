Cover and bring to boil, then reduce to a simmer and cook until rice is tender, about 20 minutes.                                                                                                                            2                                                                            While rice is cooking, heat oil over high heat in slope-sided pan (if you have a wok, use it; if not, use small saucepan), just enough to coat bottom by 1/2 inch. When oil shimmers, add curd chiles. Toss continually until golden brown, 15-30 seconds.

When oil shimmers, add mustard seeds and stir to coat in oil. When seeds begin to pop, add asafoetida, cumin, and curry leaves. Fry until aromatic, about 10 seconds, then remove from heat.                                                                                                                             4                                                                            If using wok, add cooked rice to spice oil and mix to combine.
