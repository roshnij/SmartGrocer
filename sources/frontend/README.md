### Development

First of all, you need to install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org) and npm (included with nodejs). Then install yarn:

```bash
npm install -g yarn
```

Then, to run the application, execute:

```bash
yarn
yarn run
```

### Building and Deploying
- Run `yarn run build`, which will compile all the necessary files to the `build` folder.
- Upload the contents of the `build` folder to your web server's root folder.
